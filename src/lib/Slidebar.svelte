			Attribution is to üî• Rafa üî•, who did a wonderful job on the design and I've learned so much
			from the CSS code which is remarkably extensive. So what did I do? I morphed the code to
			Svelte as an experiment on how to re-write code the Svelte way. I achieved a modest reduction
			in the code, leveraged Svelte's reactivity and declarative style and could probably do more
			(Rafa likes div's üëç) Here is the original codepen <a
